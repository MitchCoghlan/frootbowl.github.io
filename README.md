# frootbowl

The boss has given you a task, it's to catch as many fruit as possible to make a living. If you make 5 mistakes you will be sacked. 

Frootbowl is a basic catching game where you earn points for each fruit you catch, it was made mostly as a hobby project and designed and scripted (mostly) by one guy.


There will be no Mac support so don't ask.
